The raw data collection parallelism is based on threads with channels between them. The blocks collector has channels to the receipts collector, and the eth calls collector. The receipts collector receives the transaction hashes to collect receipts for from the new blocks, the eth calls collector receives the new blocks to collect configured calls for. From the receipts collector, there are channels to the logs and factories collectors (this channel only exists if there are configured factories). They both receive logs, the logs collector writes parquet files for logs separate from the receipts files, and the factories collector collects new factory contract addresses based on the logs and the configured factories. If contract_logs_only is set to true in the config, there is a channel from factories to logs so that the logs collector knows it needs to keep the new factory contracts. If any factories have configured eth calls, there is a channel from the factories collector to the eth calls collector so it can know to collect results for eth calls on new factory contracts.
